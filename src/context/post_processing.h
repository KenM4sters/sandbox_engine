/**
 * The PostProcessing class completely changes the way that the scene is rendered to the window.
 * Instead of rendering a scene as usual, if PostProcessing is enabled, then the entire scene is instead
 * rendered as a texture to a quad that is drawn to perfectly fit the window dimensions. 
 * 
 * The benefit of this is that we can very easily manipulate fragment data of a texture and even the
 * quad vertex data itself, allowing for a whole host of so called "postprocesssing" techniques to 
 * enhace the visual output of our program. Some examples would include inverting colors, bloating and blurring
 * them to achieve a "bloom" effect, and so on...
